# LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Climbing Robot Project

## Project Overview

This project involves programming a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot to navigate and climb stairs. The robot is equipped with various sensors and motors that enable it to detect its environment, move accurately, and avoid obstacles. The main goal is to have the robot climb up and down a set of stairs efficiently.

## Objectives

- **Design and build a robot** that can navigate and climb stairs.
- **Implement control algorithms** to manage the robot's movement and orientation.
- **Use sensors to detect obstacles** and ensure precise navigation.

## Components Used

### EV3 Brick

The EV3 Brick is the main control unit of the robot. It processes inputs from the sensors and sends commands to the motors.

### Motors

- **Front Motor**: Drives the front wheels of the robot.
- **Rear Motor**: Drives the rear wheels of the robot.
- **Lift Motor**: Lifts the rear structure of the robot to assist in climbing.

### Sensors

- **Gyro Sensor**: Measures the angle of the robot to help maintain its balance and orientation.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures the distance to obstacles to prevent collisions.
- **Touch Sensor**: Detects when the rear structure has reached its maximum position to control the lifting mechanism.

## Functionality

1. **Resetting the Climber**: The robot initializes by resetting the positions of its motors and sensors to ensure accurate movement.
2. **Climbing Up Stairs**: The robot moves forward while adjusting its lift motor to climb each step. The Gyro Sensor helps maintain the correct angle.
3. **Descending Stairs**: The robot uses the Ultrasonic Sensor to detect the edge of the stairs and adjusts its motors to descend safely.
4. **Settling the Robot**: The robot ensures it is stable after climbing or descending stairs by making fine adjustments using its sensors and motors.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Battery Issues**: Initial battery issues were resolved by replacing the battery.
- **Motion Accuracy**: The robot's movement was fine-tuned using precise motor control and sensor feedback.
- **Orientation Management**: Implementing the Gyro Sensor helped maintain the correct orientation of the robot while climbing.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the capability of the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 system to perform complex tasks such as climbing stairs. By utilizing a combination of motors and sensors, the robot can navigate its environment and overcome obstacles efficiently. This project also highlights the importance of sensor integration and precise motor control in robotics.
